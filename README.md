# Neovim resource file and binaries
This project serves as a personal container for self-made binaries and
command-line utilities. Additionally it comes with Vimscript resource files
and snippets that are in cross-platform use. This project is basically made for
personal use.

## Neovim and vimscript
This git project contains a neovim resource file **init.vim**,
that depends on the installation of [Junegunns Vim-plug plugin](https://github.com/Junegunn/vim-plug).
It contains some functions and keymaps, that I prefer and many code lines are
inspired by Steve Losh's awesome book [Learn Vimscript the Hard
Way](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com).

## Binaries
The directory **bin** is composed of some executables in first place made for Darwin
and Linux. The file **zsh.rc** contains personal configuration for the z-shell.
The [OH-MY-ZSH-framework](https://ohmyz.sh) is to be installed first.

## Branches
There are essentially two main branches: **UbuntuOnWindows** and **Master**. The first branch contains
a version suitable for Ubuntu installed on [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) on Windows 10 and the Master branch is made for Apple's [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)) operating system.
