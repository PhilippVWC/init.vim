# Neovim resource file and binaries
This project serves as a personal container for self-made binaries and
command-line utilities. Additionally it comes with Vimscript resource files
and snippets that are in cross platform use. This project is basically for
personal use.

## Neovim and vimscript
This git project contains a neovim resource file **init.vim**,
that depends on the installation of [Junegunns Vim-plug plugin](https://github.com/Junegunn/vim-plug).
It contains some functions and key maps, that I prefer.

## Binaries
The directory **bin** is composed of some executables in first place made for Darwin
and Linux. The file **zsh.rc** contains personal configuration for the z-shell.
The [OH-MY-ZSH-framework](https://ohmyz.sh) is to be installed first.

## Branches
There are two branches: **UbuntuOnWindows** and **Master**. The first branch contains
a version suitable for Ubuntu installed on a WSL2 on Windows and the latter is made for
Apple's Darwin OS.
